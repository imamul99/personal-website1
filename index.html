            <h2>Develop without limit</h2>
            <p>As developers, we like to chase perfection. It is one of the reasons why we can very easily become
                addicted to refactoring. Refactoring might give you that instant gratification you are probably not
                getting from your day to day development tasks at work. My advice would be to try and figure out a way
                to fix this counterproductive behaviour and act in the best interest of your company, your career and
                your well-being by breaking this highly disruptive infinite loop.Focus more on the actual software
                design and allow the low-level implementation details to be a little
                dirtier as long as they are doing the right thing. A broken design will most likely compromise most
                deadlines and will destroy your motivation, while a not-so-dry but nicely designed working software will
                usually suffice.</p>
